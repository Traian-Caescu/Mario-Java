"Zeo","Kid, why are you here alone?"
"Child","Who are you?"
"Zeo","Commander Zeo of the Squadron 2X3"
"Child","Can you save my parents and the other villagers then?"
"Zeo","What happened to them?"
"Child","They were taken by the Kaizers."
"Zeo","Do you know where they were taken?"
"Child","*Shakes head* No, but one of the Kaizers mentioned something about a generator."
"Zeo","Okay, stay hidden, I will save your parents and the other villagers."
"Child","Yes sir!"
"Zeo","Rei, did you find anything?"
"Rei","Yes, I located several life signatures to the south of your location as well as a few generators."
"Zeo","Good job. Keep watch of the kid while I'm gone."
"Rei","Roger that, Commander!"
