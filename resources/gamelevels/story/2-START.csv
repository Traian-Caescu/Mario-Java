"Rei","Commander, are we sure we are fighting for the right side?"
"Zeo","What do you mean?"
"Rei","Well if these robots are sentient, doesn’t that mean they have feelings as well? Why are we better than them?"
"Zeo","Well it’s simple! They are trying to overthrow us, so therefore, we are in the right."
"Rei","…Right."
"Zeo","Wait what’s that in the distance? Another robot?"
"Rei","Appears to be a child, commander."
"Zeo","A child?! ARE THEY CRAZY. FIND OUT WHAT THEY WANT AND GET THEM OUT OF HERE!"
"Rei","Yes, Commander"
